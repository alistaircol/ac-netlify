I have set up a NAS which runs a few (samba/[SMB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block)) file shares for Plex and Steam libraries and others.

A Raspberry Pi is running [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) as the primary DNS, providing added privacy for all devices on the network.

In the past I've also used Raspberry Pi to create a separate wireless networks which then uses a VPN or PPTP to do various things.

Another project I've setup was to use [squid](http://www.squid-cache.org) to monitor traffic from mobile devices to see what mobile apps are up to.
