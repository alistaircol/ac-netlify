I plan on writing some articles.

* Docker: one ingress `nginx` reverse proxy to multiple `php-apache` containers with different `xDebug` configurations.
* Bash: quick tools using `zenity` and `pdftk` to manipulate PDF files:
    * `cut`
    * `append`
    * `convert`
* Bash: server checklist with questions in `whiptail` and answers logged to syslog with `logger`
* MySQL: Read replicas
* PHP: Nicer use of `tcpdf`
* Bash: Some `pv` scripts
