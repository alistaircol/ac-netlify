I plan on writing some articles.

* Misc: Very basic Google Chrome extension to list dev sites, show which branch is on there, time of last remote push, etc.
* Bash: quick tools using `zenity` and `pdftk` to manipulate PDF files:
    * `cut`
    * `append`
    * `convert`
* MySQL: Read replicas
* PHP: Nicer use of `tcpdf` with [`call_user_func_array`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func-array.php)
* Bash: Some `pv` scripts
* JS & PHP: some [`ui-grid`](http://ui-grid.info/docs/#!/tutorial) things.
