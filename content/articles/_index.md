Some things I want to learn and write about (even if it's just for myself) in future:

* **js**: very basic Google Chrome extension to list dev sites, show which branch is on there, time of last remote push, etc. *WIP*
* **js**: some [`ui-grid`](http://ui-grid.info/docs/#!/tutorial) things.
* **sh**: Some `pv` scripts
* **mysql**: app migration, segregation and replication *WIP*
* **php**: `phpamqp` RabbitMQ & PHP consumers *WIP*
* **php**: nicer use of `tcpdf` with [`call_user_func_array`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func-array.php)

Mostly the articles below are just a place to dump what I think are some pretty neat, or exotic commands for my future reference.
