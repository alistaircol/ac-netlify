Some things I want to learn and write about (even if it's just for myself) in the future:

* **js/sh**: very basic Google Chrome extension to list dev sites, show which branch is on there, time of last remote push, etc. *WIP*
* **mysql**: app migration, segregation and replication *WIP*
* ~~**php**: nicer use of `tcpdf` with [`call_user_func_array`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func-array.php)~~ - probably just use a better IDE.
* **js**: some [`ui-grid`](http://ui-grid.info/docs/#!/tutorial) things.
* **sh**: Some `pv` scripts. *WIP*
* **sh**: [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/alistaircol) kata - `gnuplot` for debugging some geometry things.
* **php**: codewars kata debugging slowness with `xdebug` profiler and `kcachegrind`.
* **sh**: random `graphviz` and `dot` things. *WIP*
* **php**: doxygen documentation generation.
* **misc**: ansible and other server maintenance things, i.e. `motd` and `unattended-upgrades`.
* **misc**: sonarqube code analysis.
* **js**: nuxt config from CD pipeline/repository variables.
* **git**: tags, configs, signing commits.
* **docker/k8s**: rancher, heimdall.

Mostly the articles below are just a place to dump what I think are some pretty neat, or exotic commands for my future reference.
