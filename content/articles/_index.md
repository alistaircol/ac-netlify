Some things I want to learn and write about (even if it's just for myself) in the future:

* **js/sh**: very basic Google Chrome extension to list dev sites, show which branch is on there, time of last remote push, etc. *WIP*
* **mysql**: app migration, segregation and replication *WIP*
* **php**: nicer use of `tcpdf` with [`call_user_func_array`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func-array.php)
* **js**: some [`ui-grid`](http://ui-grid.info/docs/#!/tutorial) things.
* **sh**: Some `pv` scripts
* **sh**: [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/alistaircol) kata - `gnuplot` for debugging some geometry things
* **php**: codewars kata debugging slowness with `xdebug` profiler and `kcachegrind`
* **sh**: random `graphviz` and `dot` things
* **php**: doxygen documentation generation

Mostly the articles below are just a place to dump what I think are some pretty neat, or exotic commands for my future reference.
