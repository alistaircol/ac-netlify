> I use Arch, btw.

I actually use Manjaro so I think that counts. Also `i3wm` is kinda cool, except when you have to use MS teams, ugh, the notifications are awful.

Things on my list to learn or implement into daily work:

* PHP QA tools (I spent some time to learn this, have a pointless article (which you shouldn't waste your time reading) about it)
* Jenkins (my current workflow makes this an absolute pain in the arse so I haven't written about it)
* Git workflows (Kinda integrated PHP QA tools into this, but ultimately probably a waste of fucking time)

Lots of fun!
